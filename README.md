# OpenCv
-> My starting foots in OpenCv and image recognition.


# HOW TO START

-> Install OpenCV once you have python installed and prefer JetBrains Pycharm IDE

-> run commands:

  > `pip3` install `opencv-python`
  
  > `pip3` install `mediapipe`
  
  > `pip3` install `numpy`


-> Mediapipe is a `Google` based cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines. In short, it helps me in recognizing my hand :)
